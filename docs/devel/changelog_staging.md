# Changelog for next release
- Reset main branch to stable and shifted v5 development to a branch, so that pdfium updates (and possibly bug fixes) can still be handled.
  v5 development is delayed and unexpectedly tough, so this seemed necessary.
  The automated schedule has been slowed down from weekly to monthly for the time being.
  Further manual releases may be triggered as necessary.
