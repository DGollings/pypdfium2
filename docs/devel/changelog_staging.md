# Changelog for next release
- Added a new support model `PdfImageObject` (which inherits from `PdfPageObject`). This can be used to insert a JPEG image into a page, get metadata, etc.
- Docs: The changelog page now selectively includes an entry for the next release that may be shown on `latest` builds.
