# Changelog for next release
- Switched PyPI upload to "trusted publishing", which is considered safer.
- `PdfTextPage.get_text_range()`: Correct the allocation in case of excluded/inserted chars, modify scope to prevent pdfium from reading beyond `range(index, index+count)` (which otherwise it does with leading excluded chars). Update docs to note the two different representations. Thanks to Nikita Rybak for the discovery.
